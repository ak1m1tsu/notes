## Load balancing: 

Load balancing is a technique for distributing incoming requests across multiple servers in order to ensure that no single server becomes a bottleneck. Load balancing can be achieved through hardware load balancers or software load balancers, such as Nginx or HAProxy. Load balancing helps ensure that the service can handle a large number of concurrent requests and avoid downtime.

## Caching: 

Caching is a technique for storing frequently accessed data in memory so that it can be quickly retrieved. Caching reduces the load on the database and speeds up response times for frequently requested data. For example, the availability of vehicles could be cached to reduce the number of database queries required to retrieve this information.

## Database scalability: 

As the number of reservations grows, the database can become a bottleneck. To scale the database, sharding or horizontal partitioning can be used to spread the data across multiple servers. Sharding involves dividing the data into smaller partitions and storing each partition on a separate server. Horizontal partitioning involves splitting a table into smaller tables and storing each table on a separate server. Both sharding and horizontal partitioning allow for the database to scale horizontally, which is an effective way to scale a database when the number of records grows.

## Auto-scaling: 

Auto-scaling is a technique for automatically adding or removing resources from the system in response to changes in demand. In the context of a car rental service, auto-scaling can be used to automatically add more servers or database nodes in response to increased traffic or demand for reservations. This helps ensure that the service can handle fluctuations in demand without downtime.

## Microservices architecture: 

Microservices is an architectural style that involves building an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, such as managing vehicles or handling reservations. Microservices architecture helps improve scalability by allowing the service to scale specific parts of the application that are experiencing high demand, rather than having to scale the entire application. This also helps to improve the maintainability of the service, as each service can be updated and deployed independently of other services.
