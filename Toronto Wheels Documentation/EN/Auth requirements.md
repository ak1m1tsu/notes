## User Login

Customers should be able to create an account and log in to the car rental service using a unique username and password.

Upon successful login, customers should be able to access their account information, including their reservation history, personal information, and payment information.

The system should securely store login credentials to ensure that the customer's information is protected.

The system should also provide mechanisms for customers to reset their password if they forget it.

## Employee Login

Employees should be able to log in to the car rental service using a unique username and password.

Upon successful login, employees should be able to access the administrative functions of the system, including fleet management, reservation management, and customer service management.

The system should have role-based access control to ensure that employees are only able to access the parts of the system that are relevant to their job function.

The system should securely store login credentials to ensure that the employee's information is protected.

The system should also provide mechanisms for employees to reset their password if they forget it.

## Role-based Access

The car rental service should have a system for managing user roles and permissions.

Different users should have access to different parts of the system based on their role, for example, customers should only be able to access their own information, while employees should have access to all customer information and the ability to manage the fleet and process reservations.

The system should enforce these role-based access controls to ensure that users are only able to access the parts of the system that they are authorized to access.

## Secure Communication

The car rental service should use encryption to secure all communication between the client and server.

This can be achieved using secure protocols such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS to encrypt all data transmitted between the client and server.

This helps to ensure that customer information is protected and cannot be intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties during transmission.

## Session Management

The car rental service should have a system for managing user sessions.

This system should ensure that users are only able to access the parts of the system that they are authorized to access and that their session is terminated when they log out or after a certain period of inactivity.

This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the system and protects sensitive information.

## Data Encryption

The car rental service should use encryption to protect sensitive information stored in the database, such as customer information, payment information, and reservation information.

This can be achieved using techniques such as field-level encryption or full-database encryption to protect the data both at rest and in transit.

This helps to ensure that customer information is protected even if the database is compromised, and that it cannot be accessed or used by unauthorized parties.

## Password management

The car rental service should have a password management policy in place to ensure that customer and employee passwords are stored securely.

Passwords should be hashed and salted before they are stored in the database to protect against attacks such as password cracking or database breaches.

The system should also enforce strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, and unique history, to ensure that passwords are not easily guessed or cracked.

The system should provide mechanisms for customers and employees to change their passwords, and for customers to reset their passwords if they forget them.
