## Centralized error logging: 

All errors that occur within the car rental service should be logged in a centralized manner, such as a log file or a log management service like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). This makes it easier to monitor and diagnose errors as they occur, and helps ensure that errors are not missed. The logged information should include the error message, stack trace, time and date of occurrence, and any relevant context information such as the user who encountered the error.

## Error classification: 

Errors should be classified into different categories based on their severity, such as critical, warning, and informational. This helps prioritize errors based on their impact on the service, so that critical errors can be addressed first. The error classification system should also allow for custom categories based on the specific needs of the car rental service.

## Error notifications: 

Notifications should be sent to relevant parties, such as developers or support staff, when errors occur. This helps ensure that errors are promptly addressed and resolved. Notifications could be sent via email, SMS, or a messaging platform like Slack. The notification should include information about the error, such as its type, severity, and context.

## Error recovery: 

Where possible, the car rental service should be designed to automatically recover from errors, such as by retrying a failed request. This helps minimize the impact of errors on the service and ensure that it remains highly available. For example, if a request to retrieve a customer's reservation fails due to a network error, the service could retry the request after a short period of time.

## Error reporting: 

Error reports should be made available to relevant parties, such as developers or support staff, to help diagnose and resolve errors. This could be done through a user-friendly interface, such as an error dashboard, or through an API that allows developers to retrieve error information programmatically.
